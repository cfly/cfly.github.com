<div id="msgcns!66CD003054696B87!830" class="bvMsg">
<div>Verse 1</div>
<div>I'm loving living every single day but sometimes I feel so....<br />I hope to find a little peace of mind and I just want to know.</div>
<div>Bridge:</div>
<div>And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be.<br />Where is home on the milky way of stars, I dry my eyes again.</div>
<div>Chorus:</div>
<div>In my dreams I am not so far away from home,<br />What am I in a world so far away from home,<br />All my life all the time so far away from home,<br />Without you I will be so far away from home.</div>
<div>Verse 2</div>
<div>If we could make it through the darkest Night we'd have a brighter day.<br />the world I see beyond your pretty eyes, makes me want to stay.</div>
<div>Bridge:</div>
<div>And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be.<br />Where is home on the milky way of stars, I dry my eyes again.</div>
<div>Chorus:</div>
<div>In my dreams I am not so far away from home,<br />What am I in a world so far away from home,<br />All my life all the time so far away from home,<br />Without you I will be so far away from home.</div>
<div>Verse 3</div>
<div>I count on you, no matter what they say, cause love can find its time.<br />I hope to be a part of you again, baby let us shine.</div>
<div>Bridge:</div>
<div>And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be.<br />Where is home on the milky way of stars, I dry my eyes again.</div>
<div>Chorus: x2</div>
<div>In my dreams I am not so far away from home,<br />What am I in a world so far away from home,<br />All my life all the time so far away from home,<br />Without you I will be so far away from home....</div>
</div>
